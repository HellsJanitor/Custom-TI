### Overview

This mod removes *most* of the vanilla integration commands, and replaces them with custom spawns, hordes, and buffs/debuffs

Dance Off and Silly Sounds are the only actions that can be used with Pimp Points (PP)

Normal, Feral and Radiated single zombies can be spawned with Special Points (SP)

For **every** other action, Bits are used

No special extension required - the mod works with the 7 Days to Die Twitch Integration extension.

All commands are as configurable as vanilla commands, via integration's menu. **All** actions are enabled by default, but prices can be adjusted, and actions disabled if required
